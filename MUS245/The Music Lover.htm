<P align=left>The Music Lover's Manifesto:</P></B></FONT><FONT 
face=TimesNewRomanPSMT size=5>
<P align=left>Why buying CDs hurts the musician and supports 
tyranny.</P></FONT><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPSMT>
<P align=left>The music industry is in turmoil. The rise and fall of Napster has 
unearthed the ugly</P>
<P align=left>nature of the record labels and their congressional lobbying 
group, the Recording Industry</P>
<P align=left>Association of America (RIAA). Since the successful annihilation 
of Napster the</P>
<P align=left>corporate record labels have begun bombarding us with propaganda 
against other file</P>
<P align=left>sharing services. Once we understand just why the music industry 
is afraid of the Internet,</P>
<P align=left>it becomes clear that the industry is not fighting against piracy. 
It is, in fact, desperately</P>
<P align=left>fighting to maintain the financial wealth it garners from the 
exploitation of musicians.</P>
<P align=left>Despite the industrys PR campaign about lost revenue, a simple 
look at the SoundScan</P>
<P align=left>numbers during Napster's lifetime reveals a steady increase in 
album sales (this fact can be</P>
<P align=left>found on the RIAAs own website, under "Market Data"). CD sales 
continued to increase</P>
<P align=left>even when the economy started to sour, and this increase continued 
until near the instant</P>
<P align=left>that Napster went offline. In effect, Napster was one of the best 
things to happen to music</P>
<P align=left>in a long timeand this makes perfect sense: the more music people 
were exposed to, the</P>
<P align=left>more music people wanted to buy. The music industry also appeared 
to have the perfect</P>
<P align=left>marketing tool in that they wouldn't have to do any marketingthe 
good artists would</P>
<P align=left>sell themselves. And as far as piracy was concerned, Napster was 
perfect in that regard,</P>
<P align=left>as well. The simple fact that it was peer to peer meant that it 
was virtually impossible to</P>
<P align=left>download a complete album of any consistent quality. Every track 
was recorded from a</P>
<P align=left>different source, different bit rate, different audio levels, 
etc., making downloading a</P>
<P align=left>complete album that resembled the quality of a purchased one 
extremely difficult.</P>
<P align=left>So, given that Napster improved album sales and could have been a 
great marketing tool,</P>
<P align=left>why were the corporate labels so eager to shut it down? The answer 
is simple: they saw it</P>
<P align=left>as a threat to their </FONT><FONT 
face=TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT><I>control over the musicians</I></FONT><FONT 
face=TimesNewRomanPSMT>. We must begin to look at this from the</P>
<P align=left>perspective of the highest people in the industrythe Tommy 
Mattolla's (who has recently</P>
<P align=left>been forced out of his power seat), the Clive Davis's, etc. These 
are intelligent and</P>
<P align=left>powerful men, and they make millions of dollars on the musicians 
they exploit. And</P>
<P align=left>without this system of exploitation, their power and unlimited 
wealth would come to an</P>
<P align=left>end.</P>
<P align=left>Here is how the exploitation works. When an artist first signs to 
a major label, visions of</P>
<P align=left>millions of dollars and thousands of screaming fans allow them to 
sign their freedom away</P>
<P align=left>on a dotted line. A typical contract goes something like this: the 
artist forever loses all</P>
<P align=left>copyright and control over any music recorded during the length of 
the contract; the artist</P>
<P align=left>loses the final say over what songs end up on the album; the 
artist loses the right to say</P>
<P align=left>what his music can and can't be used for (e.g., suddenly, the 
artists most cherished song</P>
<P align=left>can be used to sell long distance, or SUVs); and, finally, the 
musician signs away these</P>
<P align=left>rights to future recordings. But the most telling piece of freedom 
the artist loses is when</P>
<P align=left>he </FONT><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT><I>signs away the 
ownership to his own name</I></FONT><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPSMT>. That thing 
that makes a band a band,</P>
<P align=left>makes a rapper a rapper, even an individual an individual, now 
belongs to the record label.</P>
<P align=left>Recall that Prince changed his name to an unpronounceable symbol 
precisely because</P>
<P align=left>Warner Bros. owned his name.</P>
<P align=left>To the label, the artist is no more then a servant who is there to 
do its bidding and to</P>
<P align=left>generate massive amounts of capital. In return, the label grants 
the artist a tiny cut of the</P>
<P align=left>wealth that he produces. When indentured servitude was a common 
part of life, the</P>
<P align=left>masters would sometimes allow their servants to go out into the 
world and work for</P>
<P align=left>wages, then the cruel owner (having done no work) would take all 
of the servants</P>
<P align=left>earnings as his own, possibly giving the servant a few cents for 
his long labor. This is the</P>
<P align=left>relationship of the artist to the major label. By being able to 
work away from his owner,</P>
<P align=left>the servant feels almost like a free man, and the artist enjoys 
the same false sense of</P>
<P align=left>freedom. The artist is able to do many things that makes him feel 
free, but these are just</P>
<P align=left>allowances provided by the master label. The artist can do drugs, 
swear, get arrested,</P>
<P align=left>etc., and the label says nothingin fact, these things are 
encouraged because they provide</P>
<P align=left>free marketing. But until the artist completes his contract with 
the label he is still merely</P>
<P align=left>a servant.</P>
<P align=left>In exchange for giving the label all these things, the artist gets 
in return a lump sum</P>
<P align=left>ranging from $100,000 to millions of dollars</FONT><FONT 
face=TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT><I>which the artist has to pay 
back</I></FONT><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPSMT>to cover</P>
<P align=left>studio costs, manager fees, etc., and the label grants royalties 
from the sale of the album.</P>
<P align=left>These royalties are calculated in "price points" and typically 
amount to about 9¢ per</P>
<P align=left>album</FONT><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT><I>. 
</I></FONT><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPSMT>Now, this deal seems pretty bad: the 
artist has signed away all the rights to his</P>
<P align=left>music, the ownership of his name, and, indeed, his freedomin 
exchange for </FONT><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT><I>a loan and a</P>
<P align=left>few cents from each CD sold. </I></FONT><FONT 
face=TimesNewRomanPSMT>Why would an artist agree to this? The answer is 
simple:</P>
<P align=left>choosing not to sign to the major label is in essence choosing not 
to be heard.</P>
<P align=left>Historically, the selling of records was a complex venture. It 
took visionaries to predict</P>
<P align=left>what would and would not be popular. It took record company 
promotion people who</P>
<P align=left>had personal relationships with local DJ's to get a song played on 
the radio, and even then</P>
<P align=left>there was little guarantee. But, recently, the music moguls have 
found that the secret to</P>
<P align=left>making popular music is to simply maintain complete control of all 
the mainstream access</P>
<P align=left>the public has to new music. And unholy unions with the two major 
outlets of musicthe</P>
<P align=left>radio and MTVhave accomplished just this.</P>
<P align=left>In the last couple of years, the corporate labels have rejoiced 
because they no longer have</P>
<P align=left>to struggle with any local radio stations across the country for 
airtime; they now only have</P>
<P align=left>to deal with one corporation: Clear Channel Worldwide. Clear 
Channel began its take</P>
<P align=left>over of the radio waves in 1999. Since then, it has acquired 
nearly 1,500 popular radio</P>
<P align=left>stations worldwide. No longer are radio DJs in control of what 
music is played on the</P>
<P align=left>radio, it is the corporate executives in Clear Channel's corporate 
headquarters, located in</P>
<P align=left>Austin, TX, (the ones receiving huge kickbacks from the major 
labels) who control it. All</P>
<P align=left>one has to do is look at the 'press room' of the Clear Channel 
website to understand the</P>
<P align=left>horrifying corporate nature of music today. In a recent interview 
with Fortune magazine</P>
<P align=left>Clear Channel's founder and CEO, Lowry Mays (who was originally an 
investment banker</P>
<P align=left>before joining the radio business), states, "We're not in the 
business of providing news and</P>
<P align=left>information. We're not in the business of providing 
well-researched music. We're simply in</P>
<P align=left>the business of selling our customers products." Fraternity 
brothers who studied together</P>
<P align=left>at business schoolnot people who actually care about musicare 
now in charge of what</P>
<P align=left>gets played on the radio.</P>
<P align=left>This is why the peer-to-peer revolution has the industry so 
terrifiedand is also the</P>
<P align=left>reason they have fought so strongly to quash Internet radio. 
Suddenly, this new</P>
<P align=left>technology makes it possible for any musician, not just the ones 
signed to the corporate</P>
<P align=left>big wigs, to be heard by millions of people. The relationships the 
big wigs have been</P>
<P align=left>nurturing with Clear Channel and MTV have started to lose their 
value. The corporate</P>
<P align=left>labels (Bertelsmann, Sony, Universal, Warner Bros., EMI) have 
decided to fight peer-topeer</P>
<P align=left>technology with all their might. First off, they use the RIAA, 
which is the</P>
<P align=left>congressional lobbying group whose only purpose is to fight 
</FONT><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT><I>for the interests of these 
five</P>
<P align=left>labels</I></FONT><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPSMT>. The RIAA has 
absolutely no vested interest in the rights of the artist; its sole</P>
<P align=left>purpose is to perpetuate the current system of exploitation. This 
group used the millions</P>
<P align=left>of dollars it received from the labels to fight Napster in court, 
and, of course, their millions</P>
<P align=left>of dollars won against the small Internet company.</P>
<P align=left>Distorting its legal victory into a moral one, the RIAA began a 
campaign against Internet</P>
<P align=left>file sharing in which they labeled such activities "piracy," 
thereby </FONT><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT><I>accusing the majority 
of</P>
<P align=left>its costumers of being thieves</I></FONT><FONT 
face=TimesNewRomanPSMT>. It was precisely when this campaign began that CD 
sales</P>
<P align=left>began to drop.</P>
<P align=left>If Napster was good for CD sales and helped get musicians heard, 
why would so many</P>
<P align=left>artists speak out against it? For the same reason that a servant 
would try to protect his</P>
<P align=left>master when his master was in danger: their livelihood is caught 
up in the slave system.</P>
<P align=left>Artists who are already established fear the collapse of the major 
label system because</P>
<P align=left>they worry that without it, they will suddenly lose the prestige 
and wealth they continue to</P>
<P align=left>accumulate. It is the fear of the unknown that causes artists to 
stand up for their cruel</P>
<P align=left>masters. It is also possible that these artists who stand up in 
favor of tyranny may not</P>
<P align=left>even realize they are doing so, they may actually believe the 
rhetoric that the industry has</P>
<P align=left>fed them.</P>
<P align=left>We must now realize that the corporate labels and their lap dog 
lobby group will do</P>
<P align=left>anything in their power to keep this old system of servitude in 
place, and they have LOTS</P>
<P align=left>of powerbillions of dollarsand they also have congressmen who 
will do their bidding.</P>
<P align=left>But in order for them to keep their power, they rely on us. 
</FONT><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT><I>Every time we buy a CD we</P>
<P align=left>are supporting tyranny. </I></FONT><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPSMT>We 
must stop. We must stand by the musicians that we love</P>
<P align=left>we can free them. The RIAA wants to guilt us into continuing to 
buy CDs with the</P>
<P align=left>audacious claim that if we don't, we are hurting the artists. In 
reality, however, the</P>
<P align=left>opposite is true. There are many ways we can continue to support 
the musicians without</P>
<P align=left>financially supporting the corporate campaign against us. Consider 
this: if we download</P>
<P align=left>an album or copy it from a friend, and then mail the musician five 
dollars, that would be as</P>
<P align=left>much as 50 times what that musician would make if we spent $18 for 
the CD! Its up to</P>
<P align=left>us. We have the power to stop tyranny and all we have to do is 
</FONT><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT><B>stop buying CDs.</P></B></FONT><FONT

<P align=left>File Sharing</P></B></FONT><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPSMT size=5>
<P align=left>Hurts mega corporations, not musicians.</P></FONT><FONT 
face=TimesNewRomanPSMT size=2>
<P align=left>The five major labels (Sony, Universal, BMG, Warner Bros, EMI) 
would like us to believe that file</P>
<P align=left>sharing steals from musicians. Wrong! It is actually the major 
labels who steal from the musicians!</P></FONT><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT

<P align=left>What you need to know about Major Label recording 
contracts:</P></B></FONT><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPSMT size=2>
<P align=left>1.Typical royalties paid to the artist come out to about 10¢ per 
album sold.</P>
<P align=left>2.The artist loses ALL COPYRIGHT OWNERSHIP to his/her music.</P>
<P align=left>3.All recording, production, mastering, and music video production 
costs COME OUT OF THE</P>
<P align=left>ARTIST'S royalties.</P>
<P align=left>4.The label has total control over what the music is used for. The 
label is free to license anything they</P>
<P align=left>own to whoever they want. (Think about it next time you hear that 
classic song on an S.U.V.</P>
<P align=left>commercial)</P></FONT><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT size=2><B>
<P align=left>What you need to know about Clear Channel:</P></B></FONT><FONT 
face=TimesNewRomanPSMT size=2>
<P align=left>1. Owns the majority of radio stations in the U.S. (over 
1500).</P>
<P align=left>2. Receives huge payments from the 5 major labels to play major 
label owned music.</P>
<P align=left>3. Has direct ties to the Bush administration and actively censors 
artists who do not support their rightwing</P>
<P align=left>politics. (I.e. Clear Channel has stopped playing the Dixie 
Chicks)</P></FONT><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT size=2><B>
<P align=left>Why would an artist sign to a major label?</P></B></FONT><FONT 
face=TimesNewRomanPSMT size=2>
<P align=left>1. Without the major label's connection to Clear Channel the 
artist has NO CHANCE OF EVER</P>
<P align=left>BEING PLAYED ON THE RADIO.</P>
<P align=left>2. Without the major label's connection to MTV the artist has 
little chance of ever getting a video</P>
<P align=left>played.</P>
<P align=left>3. Often the artist is wooed to the label by a large advance 
(sometimes in the millions of dollars), but</P>
<P align=left>the artist has to pay this money back to the 
label.</P></FONT><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT size=2><B>
<P align=left>File sharing Facts:</P></B></FONT><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPSMT 
size=2>
<P align=left>1. File sharing gives equal exposure to ALL musicians regardless 
of corporate sponsorship.</P>
<P align=left>2. CD sales rose steadily until AFTER Napster was taken offline 
(check SoundScan numbers)CD</P>
<P align=left>sales only began to drop once the labels began calling the 
majority of their customers thieves.</P>
<P align=left>3. The major labels began to reduce the number of releases BEFORE 
the Napster hearingsEVEN</P>
<P align=left>THOUGH CD SALES WERE RISING.</P>
<P align=left>4. Independent artists are currently SELLING BETTER THEN EVER 
BEFORE.</P></FONT><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT size=2><B>
<P align=left>Why the major labels are so scared of file 
sharing.</P></B></FONT><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPSMT size=2>
<P align=left>Because the labels know that the only thing they can offer new 
artists is the chance to be heard on Clear</P>
<P align=left>Channel and seen on MTV. File sharing allows any artist to be 
heard by potentially millions of people,</P>
<P align=left>this has the corporate labels terrified. They are willing to go to 
any lengths to stop us from hearing</P>
<P align=left>independent artists. Recently the RIAA has sued a Michigan Tech 
student for sharing music with other</P>
<P align=left>students. The total amount in damages the RIAA sought from this 
single student was a whooping 97</P>
<P align=left>billion dollars! (the case was eventually settled out of 
court)</P></FONT><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT><B>
<P align=left>Every time you buy a CD you are supporting a system that exploits 
musicians and</P>
<P align=left>STEALS their intellectual property. Stop funding the persecution 
of fellow</P>
<P align=left>students! Stop giving money to huge corporations who take 99% of 
the money that</P>
<P align=left>rightly belongs to the musician! If you want to support musicians, 
consider</P>
<P align=left>downloading or copying their album and mailing them 5 dollars 
(that's fifty times</P>
<P align=left>what they would make if you paid 18$ for it!)</B></FONT><FONT
