'Program Goals:
'-- Display the following:
'          a.) The filename, including full path.
'          b.) Number of characters in bytes the file contains
'          c.) The most frequent character, represented by its ASCII code, its frequency,
'               and the percentage of the file that instances of this character comprises.
'          d.) The ASCII code of the character that appeared the most times in a row 
'               (was repeated) in the file and the number of times it appeared in a row. 
'               A chart containing each possible ASCII code (0 through 255).  That displays
'               the ASCII code, the total number of times the ASCII character appeared in the file, 
'               the percentage of the file that was made up of this character, and the
'               the maximum number of times in a row the ASCII character appeared in the file.
