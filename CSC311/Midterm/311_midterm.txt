  CSC 311 MID-TERM PROJECT DUE BACK ON MONDAY FEB 22, 2010 by 5PM
  MAKE SURE NOT TO BE LATE ON THIS MIDTERM
  this project is worth 15% of your course grade
  no late submissions will be accepted

consider the following SAMPLE data input file for the mid-term project
(the actual file may be different)
each record has 5 lines of data: 
employee name 
phone 
address 
hours worked
hourly rate

note: all input text will be in lower case in this project


write a VB project to process payroll information based on the
data in the input file. 

when the project is run, the user should be given a chance to
specify name of the input file as well as the name of the output file.

the form should have a text box where the user will 
type the first letter of the employee name whose payroll info 
is of interest.

the user will then click a button called "display pay" 

project should then compute the pay of ALL the employees
whose (last) name begins with the letter in the textbox and 
display it on the screen AS WELL AS store the result in the output file
specified by the user.


e.g.,
if the textbox has the letter: m 
the display should be (in 5 listboxes one for each column) such as below

name		hours	OT	rate	pay
miller chris 	40 	0	5.25	210.00
miller anita 	35	0	5.35 	187.25


and also at the same time APPEND it to the specified output file 


the clear button should clear the text box so the user 
can enter a different letter to process the next data.

assuming the next time the letter entered in the textbox is c
the display (when display pay button is clicked) should be 

name		hours	OT	rate	pay
clifford james 	45 	5	6.00	285.00
clinton bill 	40 	0	5.25	210.00
carter jimmy 	42 	2	5.75	247.25
clevland grover 42 	2	5.25	225.75

and the output file should now contain (both m and c) as below:
(note the blank row between the two outputs)

name		hours	OT	rate	pay
miller chris 	40 	0	5.25	210.00
miller anita 	35	0	5.35 	187.25

name		hours	OT	rate	pay
clifford james 	45 	5	6.00	285.00
clinton bill 	40 	0	5.25	210.00
carter jimmy 	42 	2	5.75	247.25
clevland grover 42 	2	5.25	225.75

(you dont need to make the file contents "aligned" or sorted by name)

the exit button should close all the files and exit the project

"exit" button should close all files and exit the project
