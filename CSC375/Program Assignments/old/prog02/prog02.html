<h2> Program 2, Due Monday March 3, 2008 (70 points)</h2>

<p>
In this assignment, your program will implement a limited amount of
unlimited precision arithmetic.  Specifically, it must support the
addition and multiplication of operands that may have as many as
75 digits apiece.  There is no complex algebra involved; all operations
are simple binary operations, i.e. "a + b" or "a * b", but it is the
data structure required for this implementation that involves the most work.

</p>

<p>Specific requirements are as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li> Use a linked list (your choice of single-, double-linked)
to store the numbers.  Each list element stores one digit of a
base 10 integer.
<br>
<br>
<li> Implement the addition and multiplication operations.  For every
pair of numbers read from input, print the results of the operation
that has been requested.
<br>
<br>
<li> Your program must read from STDIN (the keyboard) and print results
to STDOUT (the terminal).
<br>
<br>
<li> This is not a "one input/one output" program.  The program must
operate in a "while not EOF" loop, such that it continues to accept input and
produce output until the user types an EOF symbol (this is ctrl-D in Unix,
and ctrl-Z <CR> in a DOS shell on Windows).

<br><br>
<li> Input is to be in the following format:
<pre><b>
(number)
(op) (number)
</b></pre>
e.g.
<pre><b>
12341234145
+ 1348572349
</b></pre>
or
<pre><b>
123440
* 2394234
</b></pre>

That is, type the first number on a line, then type an operator and
the second number on a second line.  This format is primarily to make
input somewhat easier for you to handle:  since this program operates on
practically unlimited-precision numbers, a single value may be very long.
The input format allows you to place each number on a separate
line to make things easier to type and read.

For example:

<pre><b>
12390870924098760923092409248092345023498203948234092384134097813049
+ 568923495869456807987097094567980987780984636356532564654
</b></pre>

<br><br>
<li> The result should simply be printed as a single number on the line
immediately following the input.  For example (output is in red here):

<pre><b>
12341234145
+ 1348572349
<font color=red>13689806494 <font color=black>
12390870924098760923092409248092345023498203948234092384134097813049
+ 568923495869456807987097094567980987780984636356532564654
<font color=red>12390870924667684418961866056079442118066184936015077020490630377703<font color=black>
</b></pre>
If you wish to add minor output formatting to make it somewhat easier to read, then that is acceptable.

<br><br>
<li>Your program should be able to accept numbers as long as 75 digits in
length (somewhat shorter than an 80 character-wide terminal screen).

<br><br>

<li> Write a short (one or two page) report that simply presents an
asymptotic analysis of the run times of all operations you implemented
(that is, not the basic list operations, which are essentially given
to you, but the algorithm(s) you use to implement add and multiply).
For a given algorithm, you should present it in C++ or pseudocode and
give a short narrative of why it is &Theta;(whatever) (that symbol should be
a Theta but may not show up that way in some browsers).  Your code should
be deterministic, so you should be able to state a &Theta; (i.e. Theta) value for it.
This report must be in MS-Word or PDF generated by a word processor.
Include a title, "Program 1 asymptotic Analysis" and your name in the
heading at the top of your report.
<br><br>

<li> Paper copies of program and report are absolutely <b>un</b>desirable.  Please hand-in,
through my upload facility or Blackboard, a zip file of all source code and
word document and/or PDF file.
</ol>

<h2> Additional Notes</h2>

<p>
Your program should follow "reasonable" rules of style.  Make sure that
there is a variable dictionary (a comment block at the beginning listing
the variable names and their purpose in life) or that you illustrate the
purpose of all variables with comments as they are declared.  Make sure
that your code is properly indented to indicate blocks.  All functions should
have a comment block describing them.  All "tricky" code sections should
also have a comment block, unless comments "tabbed off to the right" work.
Line your comments up vertically.
</p>

<p>It is expected that you will use the long multiplication method
to perform multiplication.  This is the simple and intuitive, yet relatively
high growth-rate long multiplication algorithm that everyone knows.  I'm talking
about grade-school multiplication:  multiply the multiplicand by each
digit of the multiplier and then add up all the properly shifted results.
</p>

<p>
<b>I will give you 10 points extra credit if you implement a more
efficient multiplication method and add, to your report, a short
explanation of the algorithm you use.  Some examples include Karatsuba
and Toom-Cook.  You can find a good link to these algorithms at <a
href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication_algorithm> Wikipedia</a>.
</b>
</p>

<p>
Note that a multiplication requires approximately double the
number of digits of its operands.  That is, multiplying two 75-digit
numbers may result in a 150-digit number, and it <i> may</i> also require
some auxiliary intermediate storage (depending on how you implement
your list).  </p>

<h3>Other Requirements</h3>
 
<p>Name your program <b>prog02.cpp</b>.  Any programs named otherwise will
not be examined.  Make sure you separate the interface and implementation.
That means that I <em>require</em>, in addition to <b>prog02.cpp</b>,
for you to turn in "<b>.h</b>" and "<b>.cpp</b>" files (representing the
class header with only the declarations and the implementation file of
that class).  Not doing so is a 5-point deduction.
There will be a 1-point deduction for combinations of
the following:  including a compiled version of your program; including
any Visual Studio project or solution (or similar) files.
</p>

<p>
Paper copies are unnecessary, and using the file upload on my web page or Blackboard
is the preferred method of hand-in.
