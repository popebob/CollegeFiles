<h2> Program 4, Due Monday April 6, 2009 (70 points)</h2>

<p>
In this assignment, you will generate and print a graphical
representation of a maze.  You will use the UNION/FIND algorithm
together with a parent-pointer general tree representation to implement
a solution to the problem specified as follows:  given a rectangular
array with two cells specified as starting and ending locations, each
array cell initially represents a walled-off box (with 4 walls, each
wall separating it from its neighbors to the top, bottom, left, and
right).  You are to use UNION/FIND to generate the maze according to
the following simple general algorithm:

<ul>
<li> Start with walls everywhere except at the entrance and exit (for algorithmic
purposes, the 'non-walls' at the entrance/exit don't really matter).
<li> While the starting and ending cells remain disconnected:
<ol>
<li>Choose a wall (at random)
<li>Knock it down if the cells it separates are not already connected.
</ol>
</ul>

It is actually better to continue knocking cell walls down until all cells are
connected (as opposed to just the starting and ending cells), which will generate
more false leads in the maze.
</p>

<p>Of course, the UNION/FIND algorithm is used to determine whether two
cells are connected when checking a wall between them.  Each location in
the 2-D array will be a node in a general tree.  Your
program should represent each location initially as being
the only member of a single-element set (thus, for an N x M array, there will
initially be N*M sets, that is, N*M single-node trees).  Knocking down the wall
between two cells connects them, which makes the two cells part of the same
tree (and same equivalence class).  The algorithm halts either when the starting and
ending cells are members of the same class or when there is only one
equivalence class because all cells are connected.

<h3>Specific requirements for program 4 are as follows:</h3>

<dl>
<dt> <b>Maze parameters from command line</b>
<dd>In the order given here, your program should obtain a random number seed, the number of rows,
and the number of columns in the array (thus, the size of the maze), from the
command line.  This does not
mean you are to give the user a prompt.  It means that on running the program in a DOS or unix
shell, you type it on the same line as the program's execution, as in the following example, 
which shows the seed, the rows, and the columns, in that order:<br><br>
DOS:<br>
<b><pre>
C:\> prog04.exe 432 50 30
</pre></b>
or Unix:
<b><pre>
[aloysius@regal]$ ./prog04.exe 432 50 30
</pre></b>

There are two things related to this:
<ol>
<li>Arrays should be dynamically allocated.
<li>Label your output top to bottom and left to right.  That is, the first row
displayed is row zero, the first column displayed is column zero (see the
section on output format below). 
</ol>
<br>

<dt><b>Problem Size</b>
<dd>There is probably not a limit on the dimensions of the
array (other than what your C++ compiler might impose), but practically your
programs won't be tested with dimensions larger than what can be printed on
a sheet of paper.  This will
probably limit it to about 80 columns by 60 rows (or possibly less,
see the section on output format).
<br>
<br>

<dt><b>Starting and Ending Points</b>
<dd>Make the starting and ending points be the
upper left and lower right corners of the maze (for example, in a 5x14 array, this would
be locations (0,0) and (4,13) in a row-major format).

<br>
<br>
<dt><b>Specific Processing</b>
<dd> Implement weighted union and path compression in one version of the program and neither in a second version.  How you represent
the walls and even the cells is up to you, although I will have a
couple of suggestions in class.  <b>Make sure that the algorithm runs until
all cells are connected, rather than stopping when just the starting/ending
cells are connected.</b>

<br>
<br>
<dt><b>Output format:</b>
<dd>If you are good at graphical programming, whether it's Java in a
browser window or some C++ interface with Windows, then by all means do
it graphically if you have the time and energy.  Otherwise, your maze
should be printed using "crude ASCII format" as the following example
illustrates:

<p>Each maze cell takes up 4 display cells on the screen, except
for certain boundary cells (the last column and the last row).  For
example, if you have a 5x14 array, then its initial state might be
displayed as follows (you won't be displaying its initial state; this
is just to illustrate the example):

<b><pre>
    0                   1
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
 0 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
 1 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
 2 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
 3 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
 4 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
</pre></b>
After the algorithm is run, then the maze might potentially look like this, which
illustrates the actual output format (the numbered labels for row/column aren't necessary):
<b><pre>
   + +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |   |     |                 |
   +-+ +-+-+ +-+-+-+-+ +-+-+-+ +
   | |     |         | | |   | |
   + +-+-+ + +-+-+-+ + + + + + +
   |         |     | |   | |   |
   + + +-+-+ + + + + +-+-+ + +-+
   | |   |     | | |     | |   |
   + +-+ +-+-+ +-+ +-+ +-+ +-+ +
   |   |     | |     |     |   |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ +
</pre></b>
Because each cell shares common wall locations with 4 neighbors, it
should be obvious that you need to print them out in a very regular
fashion. For example, while iterating through rows/columns, each cell
location should be responsible for printing out its upper and left
wall region.  The boundary cells that have special conditions are then the
last column and the last row (the last column also needs to print its
right wall, and the last row needs to print its lower wall).

<dt><b>Report</b>
<dd>Write a short report (office format or PDF) that gives a comparison of the number
of steps required (on average) for "several" mazes of varying sizes (i.e.,
run your program with several mazes that have the same number of cells
then average the counts; repeat for several different cell counts).  In
this case, "steps" involves the number of general tree links you must
traverse when doing a FIND operation to determine set membership.
The comparison should be of these two implementations:
<ul>
<li>General tree using weighted union and path compression
<li>General tree using neither of the above
</ul>

Please try not to make this too difficult.  You should be able
to use the code on the web page, although you might have to modify it a
little bit to remove the weighted union rule.
</dl>

<h3>Other Requirements</h3>

<p>Name your program <b>prog04.cpp</b>.  Any programs named otherwise will
not be examined.  Make sure you separate the interface and implementation.
That means that I <em>require</em>, in addition to <b>prog04.cpp</b>,
for you to turn in "<b>.h</b>" and "<b>.cpp</b>" files (representing the
class header with only the declarations and the implementation file of
that class).  Not doing so is a 5-point deduction.
There will be a 1-point deduction for combinations of
the following:  including a compiled version of your program; including
any Visual Studio project or solution (or similar) files.
</p>

<p>
Paper copies are unnecessary. Using the file upload on my web page
or sending in email are the acceptable methods of hand-in.
</p>

<p>In your comment block to begin your main program, other than the
function of the program and the variable dictionary, include a comment
of the following format. The most important things are your name and
the compiler you used:
</p>
<pre>
// Name:         Joe M. Student
// Program:      CSC 375 Program 4
// Due Date:     Friday April 3, 2009
// Compiler:     (whatever one you used.)
</pre>
   
<p>
Your program must follow "reasonable" rules of style.  Make sure that
there is a variable dictionary or that you illustrate the purpose of all
variables with comments. Make sure that your code is properly indented to
indicate blocks, etc.
</p>

<h3> Additional Information </h3>

<p>From the Unix man page on generating random numbers:</p>
<pre><b>
      "If  you want to generate a random integer between 1 and 10, you
      should always do it by using high-order bits, as in
 
             j=1+(int) (10.0*rand()/(RAND_MAX+1.0));
 
      and never by anything resembling
 
             j=1+(rand() % 10);
</b></pre>


<p>So for example, if you have n rows, you want to generate a random number
between 0 and (n-1):</p>
<b><pre>
             j=0+(int) (((float) (n-1)) *rand()/(RAND_MAX+1.0));
</b></pre>

<p>The other part is seed, which is srand:</p>

<b><pre>
  srand(atoi(argv[1]));
</b></pre>

<p>As far as the include file:</p>
<b><pre>
#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;
</b></pre>
should work.
