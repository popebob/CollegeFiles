<h2> Program 5, Due Wednesday April 22, 2009 (70 points)</h2>

<p> In this assignment, you will implement a spell checker program
using hashing techniques.  Given the names of an input dictionary file
and an input check-file, your program will read the dictionary
into a hash table, then it will read through the check file and indicate
in the screen output what words were found to be in error according to
the dictionary.  </p>

<p> This is done as follows:  first, for every word read from the dictionary file,
insert it into the hash table using an appropriate hash function
and a probing technique specified below.  The hash becomes an internal spelling
database.  Second, for every word read from the
check file (separated by whitespace), search the hash
for that word.  Successfully finding it in the table means that it
is correctly spelled, according to the current dictionary.  Failure to find
it means that it is deemed incorrectly spelled.  The output is straightforward:
it is a series of one-word lines that indicate what words the program thinks
are not correctly spelled (as well as some statistics as specified below).</p>


<p>You will be testing some collision resolution policies against each
other with varying hash table sizes to compare their relative
performance under the conditions imposed by this assignment.
This will be measured by counting the total number of steps
taken in attempting to find word positions in the hash table.  This includes
inserting the dictionary words and searching for the check-file words.
That is, a "step" is the act of comparing a location in the hash table with
a word being checked or inserted, whether it's at a home position or during
a probe.
</p>

<h3>Specific Requirements</h3>

<p>In brief:
<ul>
<li>The input files will be specified on the command line.
<li>The output is a list of "misspelled" words, followed by statistics.
<li>You will use (and compare) different probing techniques as described below.
<li>You will use (and compare) several different sizes of dictionaries.
<li>You will write a summary report.
</ul></p>


<h3>Input Format</h3>

<p> The dictionary file will be a list of words, one per line.  Proper names
may be capitalized, but all other words should be all lower-case.  The
check file will be any ASCII text file that I happen to come up with.  I will
find web sites with various stories from which I'll cut and paste into
sample input files.  Treat words in a case-insensitive fashion.  For example,
treat "Treat" and "treat" as the same word.
</p>

<h3>Output Format</h3>

<p>The output looks the same as the output of the unix spell command
(see <a href=prog05-spell.html> prog05-spell.html</a>), with the
additional requirement of printing a
performance summary after the "misspelled word" output.
The performance summary should include:</p>

<ul>
<li> The identity of the probing technique currently used.
<li> The number of misspelled words found
<li> The count of the number of steps used for the hashing technique
</ul>
<p>
The count that is printed includes insert steps and search steps.  That is,
count the number of steps it takes to insert words from the dictionary
file, and also count the number of steps it takes to search for words
from the check file.  For purposes of this assignment, "steps" are search steps,
whether you are looking for a word in the hash table or searching for a
position into which to insert a dictionary word (don't count the actual
insert - just the number of steps it took to find its position).</p>

<p>As far as testing of different probing techniques,
I recommend that you simply recompile the program every time you wish
to test a different one.  However, please leave all relevant functions
coded in your program source.  </p>

<p>
For output format, consider the following dictionary (the words are
not listed in any particular order):  <b><tt>{this, is, in, id, test, and,
tent, a, but, testing, friendly}</tt></b>.  Now consider the following check
file:  </p>

<b><pre>
This i
a tet
</pre></b>
The output should look similar to this:

</p>
<b><pre>
i
tet

Linear probing
Number of misspelled words:  2
Number of steps:  34212
</pre></b>

<p>There are two things of note in the example above:  (1) The number of steps was made up. For this
small example, it would probably be a much smaller number. (2)
Remember that the number of steps counts the number of steps
it took to insert the dictionary words into the hash, as well as the number of
steps spent looking for words read from the check file.</p>

<h3> Hashing Techniques and Dictionary Sizes</h3>

<p>Use and compare three dictionaries.  Each has on the order of
8000, 25000, and 45000 words.  They are linked in as a zip file in
<a href=progs.html> progs.html</a> and named <b>words08k.txt</b>,
<b>words25k.txt</b>, and <b>words45k.txt</b>.  </p>

<p>Use a suitable text-based hashing function, such as the ELF hash from
my slides.  Do not use the folding method.</p>

<p>The probing techniques that you must implement and compare include:
<ul>
<li>Linear probing
<li>Double hashing
</ul>
<p>(Note:  double hashing means you need to find a second hash function.)</p>
<p>
The hash table sizes you will use are based on the size of the dictionary
file.  It is possible that a given hash size will not work with one of the
probing techniques, but unlikely.  If this is the case, then follow this rule:
<ul>
<li> If you are trying to insert a dictionary word and the probe fails to find a slot, then simply don't insert it.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
For the data files shown, use and compare performance for the following hash table sizes:

<ul>
<li> words08k.txt:  12577 and 16763
<li> words25k.txt:  37717 and 50287
<li> words45k.txt:  68141 and 90863
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Report</h3>
<p>
You should submit with your program a short report summarizing the
performance of the two probing techniques with various hash table sizes and
dictionaries, drawing conclusions as to which perform the best with
which data.  Attempt to interpret your results in your report.  </p>


<h3>Extra Credit: Spell Check Rules</h3>

<p>
I will add 5 points for each of the following rules that your
spelling checker applies to each misspelled word:

<ul>
<li> Add one character to try to find a correct word.
<li> Remove one character to try to find a correct word.
<li> Exchange adjacent characters to try to find a correct word.
</ul>
Each rule may generate a considerable number of alternative
words.  For example, consider the first rule and think of an eight
letter misspelled word, such as <b>sientist</b>;
now imagine adding 26 possible alternative letters in nine possible
locations.  For example, the letter 'c' could be tried as follows:
<b>csientist</b>, <b>scientist</b>, <b>sicentist</b>, <b>siecntist</b>,
<b>sienctist</b>, <b>sientcist</b>, <b>sienticst</b>, <b>sientisct</b>,
<b>sientistc</b>.</p>

<p>  If any alternative words are also found in the dictionary hash table,
then your program should print them immediately after the
questionable word, in a list format as follows.
Consider the same dictionary and check files as before.
The output file should look similar to this:
</p>
<pre>
i: is, in, id
tet: test, tent

Linear probing
Number of misspelled words:  2
Number of steps:  42

</pre>

<h3>Extra Credit:  Punctuation</h3>
 
<p> I will also give 5 points extra credit if you
are able to account for various punctuation and
other non-letter characters, such as dashes, periods, commas, quotation
marks, and even numeric digits.  In my example data files, there may be
many locations in which this occurs.</p>
 
<p>For example, consider the words "Berkshire", "We", and "drunk" in the
following sentence:</p>

 
<pre>
In Berkshire, Bob said "We were all drunk."
</pre>
 
<p>The point of this extra credit portion is that the comma, the quotation marks, and the period
followed by quotation marks all must be removed in order to properly
search the hash.  Otherwise, the program will consider things like
"Berkshire," (including the comma) as a word, which won't be found even
if "Berkshire" is in the dictionary.
</p>

<h2> Additional Notes</h2>
<p>
Input files are linked in to the <a href=progs.html>progs.html</a> page
that this was linked from.  The files were created in Unix
format, which means there is not a &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt; at the end of
each line; instead, they have only a &lt;CR&gt;.  Practically, it
means you may not easily be able to read them using an editor, a DOS shell, or Visual
Studio, but they should work (of course, you can easily read them if you choose to
do this on a Linux machine).  You can also invent your own input; I would encourage
that for test runs.
</p>
 
Name your program <b>prog05.cpp</b>, and name the associated interface file and implementation
file(s) accordingly, e.g. <b>hash.h</b> and <b>hash.cpp</b>.  Any programs named otherwise will
not be examined. Do not include a compiled version however it is
turned in, and paper copies are not necessary.
</p>
   
<p>In your comment block to begin your main program, other than the
function of the program and the variable dictionary, include a comment
of the following format. The most important things are your name and
the compiler you used:
</p>
<pre>
// Name:         Joe M. Student
// Program:      CSC 375 Program 5
// Due Date:     Wednesday April 22, 2009
// Compiler:     (whatever one you used.)
</pre>
   
<p>
Your program must follow "reasonable" rules of style.  Make sure that
there is a variable dictionary or that you illustrate the purpose of all
variables with comments. Make sure that your code is properly indented to
indicate blocks, etc.
