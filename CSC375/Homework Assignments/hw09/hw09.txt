Problems from Ch. 6, Shaffer (pp. 211-213):

6.9, 6.12, 6.14, 6.15

(Problems 6.9 and 6.12 are 4 points)
 
Notes:

For 6.9:  use the "Turner linked lists of child pointers" implementation from the
notes, as opposed to Shaffer's implementation.

I'll give 6 points extra credit if you can do problem 6.13
correctly.  If you do it, please indicate so on your homework.
