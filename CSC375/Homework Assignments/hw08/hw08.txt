Problems from Ch. 5, Shaffer (pp. 186-189):

5.9 (4 points), 5.10, 5.11, 5.12, 5.15, 5.17, 5.18

Additionally,

#8) Draw the BST resulting from inserting the following integers in the
    following order:

    20 5 2 10 34 45 25 16 47 25

#9) Using the image linked in with the assignment, show the BST that
    results from removing the following values:  45, 21


Problems from Ch. 6, Shaffer (pp. 211-214):

6.4, 6.5, 6.7 (4 points)

For the parent-pointer problems, showing the array is not necessary.  I am
more interested in looking at the tree that results from processing the
UNION/FIND operations.
