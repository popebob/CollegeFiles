These are all extra credit.

Do problems 1 (4 points), 2 (8 points), 3 (4 points), 4

Hint on problem 1:  I mentioned that in class...

Hints on problem 2:
  a) This one is basically just straightforward reasoning.  Use the
     definitions given.

  b) Consider proof by contradiction.  Use the pigeonhole principle.
     Also use the definitions - e.g. if the graph is not connected, then
     by definition there are at least 2 components...
