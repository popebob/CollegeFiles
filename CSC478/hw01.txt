1.2 What mathematical property do sum, product, maximum and minimum have in common that allows them to be done in parallel using a tree-structured algorithm.

1.4 Apply Bernstein's conditions to the compiler codes generated for evaluation of expressions in Figure 1-6 and Figure 1-7. In each case, determine which statements are independent of each other and can be executed in parallel. Detect and identify the type of dependences for statements that are not independent. Explain what might happen if two dependent statements are executed concurrently.
