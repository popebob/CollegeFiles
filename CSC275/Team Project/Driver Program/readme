/*Function notes and comments
 *
 *
 *
 *    indexlist::displayList
 *               ()
 *                  Creates a new pointer variable and follows through
 *                  + the linked list in entirety, calling the function printQ to
 *                  + print out all pages that a theword appears on.
 *
 *                  INCDEP: string, fstream, (iomainp), indexlist.h
 *                  FUNDEP: insertNode(string, int), pageq::printQ()
 *                  PRE:  linked list holds at least one entry
 *                  POST: Onscreen printout of everything held in the linked list
 *
 *    indexlist::index_node::index_node
 *               (string, int, index_node)
 *                  Constructer which takes in a word, a number and a linked list pointer
 *                  + that allows the list to increase size by one unit, assigning the
 *                  + varibles taken in to the varibles set in the current link.  This
 *                  + is the actual function to make an additional link in the list.

 *                  + (previous) if it already exists in the list.  If so, then call that link's
 *                  + Qinsert (add) function to append the current page number to the pageq's 
 *                  + linked list.  If the theword does not equal the state of PREVIOUS, then
