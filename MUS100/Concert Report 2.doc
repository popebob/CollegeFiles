 Flint Institute of Music have put on a series of concerts they call the "FSO Family Concerts".  The performances in this series are targeted at families with children.  On Friday, March 12, 2004, my wife and I attended the first of this year's shows at t
h
e newly-constructed Mason Elementary in Grand Blanc.  The Flint Symphony Orchestra (FSO) was the performing body, consisting of about 65 members, with all the instruments you would expect in an orchestra.  The performance was held in a gymnasium to cater 
t
o the intended audience of children.  To my surprise, most of the children were well-behaved.  I noticed many of them paying close attention to the music.  There were 9 pieces showcased within the show, which was hosted by abc12 local television news anch
ors Bill Harris and Angie Schramski.  The concert was value-priced and very well-planned.  I felt the object of the concert was obtained; the children seemed interested in music not commonly found on the FM radio dial.

}{\i\f36\insrsid8456222\charrsid8456222 The Thrill of the Orchestra}{\f36\insrsid8456222\charrsid8456222  was narrated by Roderick Bieber.  Yes, narrated.  And very cleverly at that.  After a short introduction from Harris and Schramski, Bieber
 began to explain the parts of the orchestra.  First, percussion.  The percussionists banged their instruments randomly, as Bieber explained how easily they can make "noise".  But music, he went on, is something different altogether.  As the speaker spoke
 
of a march band, the percussion brought it to life.  He highlighted each instrument.  Snare drum, bass drum, timpani, cymbals, and so on.  He then moved on to the brass section, introducing them as the "prettiest" section of the orchestra.  He explained h
o
w sound is created by blowing through the mouthpiece.  As with percussion, the delicate line between music and noise was demonstrated.  The brass players all crudely blew through their mouthpieces, apart from the instrument, in an "annoying, buzzing" mann
e
r.  Bieber worked his way through all of the sections of the orchestra, showing each one at its best, and worst.  Bieber continued his teaching with an explanation on tone color and contrast, and how most of the beauty of the orchestra is contained in the
se concepts.  To conclude, Bieber introduced the theme of the night's concert: "The Thrill of the Orchestra".  Looking around, I could already see many of the children in attendance dancing in their parent's laps.

\f36\insrsid8456222\charrsid8456222 .  The next piece was a selection from the last movement of Gustav Mahler's }{\i\f36\insrsid8456222\charrsid8456222 Symphony No. 7 in A minor}{\f36\insrsid8456222\charrsid8456222 .  The co}{\f36\insrsid1459833 nducto}{
\f36\insrsid8456222\charrsid8456222 r, David Mairs, introduced this piece as "fast and loud" and he was right.  Dominated by brass}{\f36\insrsid3759593  and percussion}{\f36\insrsid8456222\charrsid8456222 ,}{\f36\insrsid3759593 
 this was an exciting piece.  This selection was in Rondo form, meaning it followed the pattern ABACABA, with the main theme consisting of}{\f36\insrsid1459833  heralding horns and galloping drums.
\par 
\par Harris had some trouble pronouncing the name of the composer of the next piece, Pietro Mascagni\rquote s }{\i\f36\insrsid1459833\charrsid12213400 Cavalleria Rusticana}{\f36\insrsid1459833 .  }{\f36\insrsid11041720 
After he finally got it right, he described the next selection }{\f36\insrsid11041720\charrsid12213400 as having \'93soaring strings\'94, and an \'93intense melody\'94.  }{\f36\insrsid12213400\charrsid12213400 The orchestra played an intermezzo from }{

\par }{\f36\insrsid9338602 Next up was Edvard Grieg\rquote s Prelude from }{\i\f36\insrsid9338602 Holberg }{\f36\insrsid9338602\charrsid9338602 Suite}{\f36\insrsid9338602 .  A prelude is section of }{\f36\insrsid9338602\charrsid9338602 music that precedes a }{
\f36\insrsid9338602 larger composition.  }{\f36\insrsid9338602\charrsid9338602 Mairs}{\f36\insrsid9338602  introduced the next piece as one used as inspiration for beginning violin exercises.  He instructed us to listen for the \'93run, pony, run\'94
 melody pattern.  Once they began playing, I noticed the pattern and could easily see why parts of this composition would be used to improve the skills of violinists.}{\f36\insrsid12213400 
\par }{\f36\insrsid13044623 
\par }{\f36\insrsid11283063 The next piece was written by a Russian composer in the time of Stalin.  Conductor David Mairs described the oppression of tho
se times, and how this piece was written as rebellious and mocking.  The composer, Dmitri Shostakovich, wrote }{\i\f36\insrsid11283063 Symphony No. 10 in E minor}{\f36\insrsid11283063 
 to spite Stalin.  The FSO played the allegro part of this symphony, meaning a section of music played in a brisk and lively fashion.}{\f36\insrsid4544823   This was a strong performance of a strong piece, I really enjoyed this one.}{\f36\insrsid13044623

\f36\insrsid10706017  to use Rachmaninoff\rquote s melodies in his songs.  That reference is a little before my time, but shows}{\f36\insrsid10255151  how prevalent classical music still is today.  This was a beautiful song}{\f36\insrsid3874088  tha}{

from Gustav Holst's }{\i\f36\insrsid7494545\charrsid7494545 The Planets}{\f36\insrsid7494545\charrsid7494545 .  Mairs described Holst as an Englishman who loved astronomy as much as music.  He said }{\i\f36\insrsid7494545\charrsid7494545 The Planets}{
\f36\insrsid7494545\charrsid7494545 
 was a combination of Holst's loves.  Mairs also had a bit to say about the ideas about the solar system at the time; it was believed that only six planets existed: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, the Sun, and the Moon, all of which orbited
 the Earth.  This did well to date the composition.  I like this song very much.  It was similar to the types of songs they play in movies like Braveheart and The Lord of the Rings trilogy.  The strings and woodwinds seemed to play the main theme together
 for most of the piece, with the brass and percussion acting in supporting roles.  Toward the end of }{\i\f36\insrsid7494545\charrsid7494545 Jupiter}{\f36\insrsid7494545\charrsid7494545 
 the instrument roles switched as the piece finished strong, in a fanfare-like fashion.  
\par 
\par \tab Travel}{\f36\insrsid7494545 ing}{\f36\insrsid7494545\charrsid7494545  very quickly forward in time, the Thrill brings}{\f36\insrsid7494545  us}{\f36\insrsid7494545\charrsid7494545  to
 the 20th century with a selection from the score of the Hollywood movie }{\i\f36\insrsid7494545\charrsid7494545 Gone with the Wind}{\f36\insrsid7494545\charrsid7494545 ,}{\i\f36\insrsid7494545\charrsid7494545  Tara's Theme}{
\f36\insrsid7494545\charrsid7494545 .  As you may know, Tara was the name of the plantation in the story, a wide and spacious lot eventually adored by main character Scarlet O'Hara.  In 
a movie, a theme is symbolic of its namesake and traditionally played whenever the embodiment of its title is dominant in a scene.  }{\i\f36\insrsid7494545\charrsid7494545 Tara's Theme}{\f36\insrsid7494545\charrsid7494545 
 is true to these guidelines, fairly representing the plantation.  The melodies in the composition are spacious and beautiful.  As the story goes, Tara is the most beautiful plantation of its time.  That idea is portrayed well by this appropriate theme.  

\par 
\par \tab Finally the most modern piece of the evening was introduced by Harris and Schramski.  Described as one of John Williams' best, }{\i\f36\insrsid7494545\charrsid7494545 Adventures}{\f36\insrsid7494545\charrsid7494545  }{
\i\f36\insrsid7494545\charrsid7494545 on Earth}{\f36\insrsid7494545\charrsid7494545  from }{\i\f36\insrsid7494545\charrsid7494545 E.T.}{\f36\insrsid7494545\charrsid7494545 
 concluded the evening.  As a fan of Star Wars, I thought at first that that statement was bold; however after hearing Mairs and the FSO do great justice to the musical genius of Williams, I realized the claim 
was accurate.  Very similar to the placement of this piece tonight, }{\i\f36\insrsid7494545\charrsid7494545 Adventures}{\f36\insrsid7494545\charrsid7494545 
 comes at the end of one of the highest-grossing films of all time.  Most everyone remembers the scene where E.T. and Elliot fly in front of the full moon on a bicycle, hearing this theme brings you right back to it.  }{
\i\f36\insrsid7494545\charrsid7494545 Adventures}{\f36\insrsid7494545\charrsid7494545  is a flighty composition that did well ending }{\i\f36\insrsid7494545\charrsid7494545 E.T.}{\f36\insrsid7494545\charrsid7494545 
 and did well ending this thrilling night with the orchestra.  Overall, "Thrill" lived up to its name and was excellent for children.  I would recommend any music lover from three to 103 to spend a night at the FSO's Family Concerts.
