Dr. Farmer

This is to serve as an electronic copy of our Software Design Project.  On the root you will found the two most important files, our finished SRS and finished Visio file containing almost all of our diagrams.  These copies are identical to the paper copies we are turning in.  We have enjoyed this project, this has been one of the most interesting classes have taken here at UM-Flint.  
Thank you,
