Abstract (Article Summary) 
The suit also called to question some sections of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the federal law the RIAA contends supports its latest legal actions. A spokesman for SBC said the RIAA's use of the digital copyright act in its legal quest for online song- sharers interferes with customer privacy.

The recording industry has gotten nearly 900 subpoenas against computer users suspected of illegal online music-file sharing. The RIAA is trying to compel some of the largest Internet providers, such as Verizon Communications and Comcast Cable Communications, to identify those users. A challenge by Verizon is set for appeals- court arguments Sept. 16.

SAN FRANCISCO SBC Communications is joining a legal battle with the recording industry with a lawsuit questioning the constitutionality of the industry's effort to track down online music swappers.

In a complaint filed late Wednesday in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, SBC unit Pacific Bell Internet Services alleges that many of the subpoenas served against it by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) were done so improperly.

The suit also called to question some sections of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the federal law the RIAA contends supports its latest legal actions. A spokesman for SBC said the RIAA's use of the digital copyright act in its legal quest for online song- sharers interferes with customer privacy.

The company sells SBC's Internet service in California.

"The action taken by SBC Internet Services is intended to protect the privacy of our customers," said SBC spokesman Larry Meyer.

Pac Bell claims that more than 200 subpoenas seeking file- sharers' e-mail addresses were issued from the wrong jurisdiction. The recording industry's demand for information on multiple file- sharers cannot be grouped under one subpoena, the company also contends, and the demands themselves are overly broad.

The recording industry disagreed.

"We are disappointed that Pac Bell has chosen to fight this, unlike every other ISP which has complied with their obligations under the law. We had previously reached out to SBC to discuss this matter but had been rebuked," an RIAA statement said.

San Francisco-based Pac Bell is seeking a declaration that the subpoenas are overly broad in scope and should have been issued from a California District Court, not the District of Columbia.

The recording industry has gotten nearly 900 subpoenas against computer users suspected of illegal online music-file sharing. The RIAA is trying to compel some of the largest Internet providers, such as Verizon Communications and Comcast Cable Communications, to identify those users. A challenge by Verizon is set for appeals- court arguments Sept. 16.
